# Machine Learning - Linear and Logisctic-Regression <br>
<b>Linear Regression</b>: Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an dependent variable, and the other is considered to be explanatory variable.<br>
In this project I have used [Student Performance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#) to predict the final grades of the student depending up the eplanatory variables present in the dataset.<br>
Experiment with various model parameters for both linear regression and reported on the findings as how the error varies for train and test sets with varying these parameters. Plot the results. Report your best parameters.<br>
